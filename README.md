# Portfolio
Central portfolio linking governance and operations work.

# Gregg Galvez —

This repository presents selected work samples demonstrating how I approach problems, make decisions, and deliver finished artifacts without direct supervision.

The emphasis is not on volume or credentials.
It is on clarity of reasoning, disciplined execution, and the ability to translate abstract requirements into concrete, usable outputs.

All materials are intentionally scoped, sanitized, or fictionalized where appropriate.

## What This Portfolio Is Intended to Show

In a short review, a reader should be able to see that I can:

- frame ambiguous problems into clear requirements
- make decisions using defined criteria rather than intuition
- document reasoning without overexplaining
- produce clean, reviewable artifacts suitable for real-world use
- work independently with minimal guidance

This portfolio is organized to make those signals visible quickly.

---

## How the Work Is Structured

Each project repository follows a consistent structure:

- a README explaining the problem being addressed and the approach taken
- final artifacts that represent completed work
- supporting drafts or notes where they clarify decision-making
- examples that show how rules, logic, or processes are applied in practice

This structure is intentional.  
It allows a reviewer to skim for signal or drill down for detail as needed.

## Projects

### 1) Governance Framework (Nonprofit)

This project demonstrates the ability to design and document governance systems that prioritize mission protection, consistency, and accountability.

- clearly defined thresholds and processes for decision-making
- discipline framed as safety and mission preservation, not punishment
- written rules that reduce ambiguity and discretionary abuse

**Included materials**
- sample governance policies and modules
- sanitized drafts showing iteration and refinement
- fictional scenarios illustrating how written rules are applied

Repository: `governance-framework`

### 2) Excel Operations (Data Entry / Operational Support)

This project demonstrates practical operational skills relevant to entry-level remote roles that require accuracy, consistency, and repeatable workflows.

**Key concepts demonstrated**
- data cleaning and validation
- structured spreadsheet design
- basic quality-control checks to reduce errors
- clear documentation of logic and process

**Included materials**
- example cleaned datasets
- reusable Excel templates
- brief explanations of steps and checks used

Repository: `excel-ops`

## What Is Intentionally Not Included

This portfolio does not attempt to:
- showcase every piece of work completed
- include personal background or narrative
- rely on credentials in place of evidence
- overwhelm the reader with excessive artifacts

Each included item exists to demonstrate a specific capability.

---

## Skills Demonstrated (Through Artifacts)

- governance and policy documentation
- structured decision analysis
- independent task execution
- operational spreadsheet workflows
- clear, professional written communication

## Notes for Reviewers

This portfolio is designed to be skimmed.
Headings provide orientation; linked artifacts provide depth.

If questions remain after review, they are likely questions of fit, not capability.
